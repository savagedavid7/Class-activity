# My name is David Savage

I am Canadian, but I've lived in Hong Kong and Beijing as well. My professional background is in Asset Management.
I've recently spent the past year studying Mandarin at the Beijing Language and Culture University. 
I'm deeply interested in Fintech and particularly its application to investing, Macro analysis and portfolio management.
My immediate career ambition is to find work in Asia in the Asset Management space, where I can continue to refine my language skills and gain valuable international experience.
My hope is that the technical skills I acquire from this program will not only broaden the opportunities available to me but also position me to succeed in whatever my new role might be.
